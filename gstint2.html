                { question: "When is a deposit given for the supply of goods or services or both considered as payment for such supply?", answer: "A deposit given in respect of the supply of goods or services or both is not considered as payment for such supply unless the supplier specifically applies such deposit as consideration for the said supply.", concept: "Deposits" },

                { question: "Define \"Manufacture\" according to Section 2(72) of the CGST Act.", answer: "Manufacture means processing raw material or inputs in a manner that results in the emergence of a new product having a distinct name, character, and use. The term \"manufacturer\" is construed accordingly.", concept: "Manufacture" },
                { question: "What is the scope of \"Money\" as defined in Section 2(75) of the CGST Act?", answer: "Money means Indian legal tender or any foreign currency, cheque, promissory note, bill of exchange, letter of credit, draft, or any other RBI-recognized instrument when used as consideration to settle an obligation or exchange. It does not include currency held for its numismatic value.", concept: "Money" },
                { question: "What are the three main parameters for understanding the meaning and scope of \"Supply\" under GST, as per Section 7(1)(a)?", answer: "The three main parameters are that the supply should be of goods or services, it should be made for a consideration, and it should be made in the course or furtherance of business.", concept: "Supply Parameters" },
                { question: "What are some illustrative forms of supply mentioned in Section 7(1)(a)?", answer: "The illustrative forms of supply include sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease, or disposal. These forms are not exhaustive, but rather indicative of the broad scope of supply.", concept: "Forms of Supply" },
                { question: "Explain the difference between \"barter\" and \"exchange\" in the context of supply.", answer: "Barter involves exchanging goods or services directly for other goods or services without using money. Exchange may involve a situation where goods are paid for partly in goods and partly in money.", concept: "Barter vs Exchange" },
                { question: "How are licenses, leases, and rentals of goods generally treated under GST, particularly regarding the transfer of title?", answer: "Under GST, such licenses, leases, and rentals of goods are typically covered under the supply of service, with or without the transfer of the right to use. This is because there is no transfer of title in such supplies.", concept: "Licenses and Leases" },
                { question: "What is the \"quid pro quo\" principle in relation to consideration, particularly for donations received by charitable institutions?", answer: "Quid pro quo means \"something for something.\" For donations to be considered supply, there must be an obligation on the recipient to perform a service in return, not merely an expression of gratitude or public recognition.", concept: "Quid Pro Quo" },
                { question: "Under what conditions are donations to charitable institutions not subject to GST liability?", answer: "GST is not leviable on donations if the gift or donation is made to a charitable organization, the payment has the character of a gift, and the purpose is philanthropic, leading to no commercial gain or advertisement for the donor.", concept: "Donations" },
                { question: "When do art works sent by artists to galleries for exhibition become a taxable supply under GST?", answer: "Art works sent to galleries for exhibition are not a supply because no consideration flows from the gallery to the artist at that stage. The actual supply, and applicable GST, takes place only when a buyer selects and purchases the artwork.", concept: "Artworks" },
                { question: "Why is \"No Claim Bonus\" (NCB) not considered a consideration for a supply by the insured to the insurance company?", answer: "The insured is not under a contractual obligation not to claim insurance in lieu of NCB. Therefore, the NCB deduction is not considered payment for a supply provided by the insured to the insurance company for refraining from lodging a claim.", concept: "No Claim Bonus" },
                { question: "Why is GST primarily a tax on commercial transactions, and what does this imply for supplies made in a personal capacity?", answer: "GST is essentially a tax only on commercial transactions, meaning supplies must be \"in the course or furtherance of business\" to qualify. Consequently, most supplies made by individuals in their personal capacity generally fall outside the ambit of GST.", concept: "Commercial Transactions" },
                { question: "What does the definition of \"business\" under Section 2(17) include, even without monetary benefit?", answer: "Business includes any trade, commerce, manufacture, profession, vocation, adventure, wager, or similar activity, whether or not undertaken for a monetary benefit. It also covers incidental or ancillary activities and the provision of facilities by clubs to members for consideration.", concept: "Definition of Business" },
                { question: "Are supplies made by an individual in their personal capacity always outside the ambit of GST?", answer: "Generally, yes, supplies made by an individual in their personal capacity do not come under GST unless they fall within the definition of \"business.\" However, if a supply is deemed to be made in the course or furtherance of business, it could be taxable.", concept: "Personal Capacity Supplies" },
                { question: "How does the GST law treat the importation of services for a consideration, regardless of the business aspect?", answer: "The importation of services for a consideration is treated as \"supply\" under GST, whether or not it is in the course or furtherance of business. This is a unique exception to the general requirement that a supply must be in the course or furtherance of business.", concept: "Importation of Services" },
                { question: "What is the significance of Schedule I of the CGST Act regarding \"supply\"?", answer: "Schedule I specifies activities that are treated as \"supply\" even if made without consideration. This is an important departure from the earlier indirect tax regime where consideration was always a prerequisite for tax levy.", concept: "Schedule I" },
                { question: "Under what conditions does the permanent transfer or disposal of business assets, even without consideration, qualify as a supply?", answer: "The permanent transfer or disposal of business assets without consideration qualifies as supply only if input tax credit (ITC) has been availed on such assets. If ITC was blocked or not availed, it is not deemed a supply under this provision.", concept: "Transfer of Business Assets" },
                { question: "When are supplies between \"related persons\" or \"distinct persons\" treated as supply even without consideration?", answer: "Supplies of goods or services or both between related persons or distinct persons, as specified in Section 25, qualify as supply even without consideration, provided they are made in the course or furtherance of business.", concept: "Related Persons" },
                { question: "What is the exception to treating gifts from an employer to an employee as a supply under Schedule I?", answer: "Gifts not exceeding fifty thousand rupees in value in a financial year by an employer to an employee are explicitly not treated as a supply of goods or services or both. Gifts exceeding this value, if without consideration and in the course of business, would be supply.", concept: "Gifts to Employees" },
